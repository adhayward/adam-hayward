 Personal Portfolio Site

Unfortunately, the source code for much of my professional work is not something that I am able to share. So I have put together this site detailing a number of key projects I have lead the development of to hopefully give you an idea of what I am capable of.

I have also used the development of this site to refamiliarise myself with the Laravel framework as much of my professional development used the Yii2 framework instead. 

This site is by no means considered finished but I have made it available to provide some indication of my skillset and what I can achieve in a couple of days.
