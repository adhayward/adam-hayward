                <p>My first encounter with software development came in Sixth Form at Sutton Coldfield College. Over a number of lessons we were introduced to Visual Basic 6 and worked towards building a simple calculator application. I immediately saw the potential of what we were doing and wanted to add more beyond simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. </p>
                <p>That experience started me on the journey to where I am now - always wanting to push the limits of the tools I have been given to explore new possibilities.</p>
                <p>I went on to study Mathematics at the University of Birmingham, graduated with First-Class Honours and had the <em>wonderful</em> idea of attempting to be a secondary school teacher. I quickly realised that I wasn't suited to teaching and after I had written a few simple applications to help me with that endeavour a tutor pointed out that maybe I should give professional software development a go.</p>
                <p>After brushing up my skills and aquainting myself with the Microsoft .Net Framework, I managed to get my first professional developer job at Cuskit Limited. When I arrived, Cuskit was a business built around a bespoke ERP system originally written in Informix 4GL that had been ported to VB6 and was in dire need of modernisation. My first major role was to facilitate the porting of that system into VB.Net in order to bring more modern interfaces for the users and allow us developers to move past the limitations of the very dated VB6.</p>
                <p>Cuskit went on to expand into other products beyond the ERP system and I was given the opportunity to lead the development on a number of these projects that you will find detailed in the My Projects section of this site.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I have always been a committed member of The Salvation Army in Birmingham. After growing up in the Sunday School there, I have gone on to take an active role in the church and support however I can. Where needed I use my techincal skills to support the Finance team, managing the accounts data, and the Graphic Design team, preparing materials for use in the weekly services and livestream. In addition to this, I am part of a team that supports young people in the West Midlands who are connected to The Salvation Army by providing a safe space for them to meet once a month and organising residential weekends and summer schools.</p>
